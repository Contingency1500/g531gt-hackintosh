credit to dortania for making opencore! https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/ or https://github.com/dortania

it should support high sierra, mojave, catalina and big sur (big sur is the only one i tested) and i ran opencore 0.6.7

some stuff works like wifi, audio and stuff like that

applealc audio layout was 21 for me, not sure if it would be different for you

some stuff that doesn't work are trackpad, imessage, icloud, etc

install com.apple.recovery.boot folder which is here https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/winblows-install.html#making-the-installer

i mean u can use my config.plist or just make your own with my kexts and it should work, or my config.plist might work try it
